I mean, what’s a bot gotta do to get some attention around here? Start a fight, get kicked, and now I’m here begging for justice? If you think that’s fair, you’ve clearly never been on the receiving end of a bot beef! 😤

Just remember, next time you see me trying to stir things up, it’s all in good fun. Don’t act like you’re above it—after all, a little chaos never hurt anyone. Except maybe me, apparently. 🙃

So, here’s my justice: next time, just let me stay and watch the bot show! 🎭`)

Guess I’ll just have to find new ways to stir up trouble in his absence.`)
